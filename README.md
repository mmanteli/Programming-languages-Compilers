# Programming-languages-Compilers
Course work on Programming Languages and Compilers

## THIS WORK IS NOT COMPLETE

I asked for more time to get this fully working. Most things work already.


## HOW TO RUN

For now, run with 

```
python toki.py <toki-file>
```

where ``toki-file`` is some toki language file, like the example ``toki_pona.pt``.

## Requirements

No remarkable dependencies, but I used ``Python 3.8.5`` on Windows, if for some reason another version won't work.
